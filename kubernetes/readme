# README for Kubernetes Deployment  

This repository contains Kubernetes configuration files for deploying and managing containerized applications. Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters.  

## Features  
- Deployment manifests for microservices  
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management  
- Auto-scaling and load balancing  
- Persistent storage support  

## Usage  
1. Apply configurations:  
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```  
2. Verify deployment:  
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```  

Ensure `kubectl` and a Kubernetes cluster are set up before deployment. Modify YAML files to suit your requirements.
